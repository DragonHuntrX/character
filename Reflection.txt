I envision the character I created to be some sort of ancient wizard assasin. He only shows up every once and a while, sometimes when the main character is in need of his assistance, but more often not. His skills are unmatched, but his rotting skin makes him too conspicuous to be seen in public (as is the hat, but it's his lucky one).
I feel that it is hard to pin down a percise definition of a character as a lot of what makes up a character in video games is the meaning that the player assigns to them. As discussed in the book, a lot of it is how relatable the character/object is. Dialogue is often a trait of characters, as it is very human and thus easy to relate to, making anything, from npcs to rocks, personified. An example can be seen in Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. There is a tree that talks to you and plays a role in the story. It doesn't move or even have a face, but it is characterized through it's speech alone.
However, I don't think dialogue is necessary, as there are plenty of games where there are characters that never make a sound. An good example can be seen in animals. They often interact with the player in ways that personfiy them without making saying a word, from leading the player to treasure in Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild to scaring enemies away to keep your base safe in Minecraft.
But even in these cases, if the player doesn't really assign value or think much about the animal, then it won't necassarily be a character in their mind.
If I had to go with a definition, I would say that a character is something in that interacts with a player in a way that is not purely reactionary, and in a way that is relatable to the character.
